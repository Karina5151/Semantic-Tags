# hw1-semantic-tags

## My Task
    In this assignment my goal was to replace non-semantic tags with semantic tags where appropriate. 

## Acceptance Criteria


- All `<div>` tags be reveiwed and replaced if a semantic tag is better suited
- CSS file is updated to reflect any changes to tag types in the HTML file
- The webpage looks the same as its original layout


## Mock-Up
